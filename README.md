[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort)

**Radix sort** sort is a ***non-comparative*** integer sorting algorithm that sorts data with integer keys by grouping keys by the individual digits which share the same significant position and value. A positional notation is required, but because integers can represent strings of characters (e.g., names or dates) and specially formatted floating point numbers, radix sort is not limited to integers.
